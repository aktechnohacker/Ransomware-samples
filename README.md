  <h3 align="Left">     What is Ransomware ?     </h3>
  
<p>  Ransomware is malware designed to deny a user or organization access to files on their computer. By encrypting these files and demanding a ransom payment for the decryption key, these malware place organizations in a position where paying the ransom is the easiest and cheapest way to regain access to their files. </p>









<h3 align="Left">     How to prevent Ransomware ?     </h3>

* Keep your operating system patched and up-to-date to ensure you have fewer vulnerabilities to exploit.
* Don't install software or give it administrative privileges unless you know exactly what it is and what it does.
* Install antivirus software, which detects malicious programs like ransomware as they arrive, and whitelisting software, which prevents unauthorized applications from executing in the first place.
* And, of course, back up your files, frequently and automatically! That won't stop a malware attack, but it can make the damage caused by one much less significant.





<h3 align="Left">   Ransomware removal ?     </h3>

* Reboot Windows 10 to safe mode
* Install antimalware software
* Scan the system to find the ransomware program
* Restore the computer to a previous state
